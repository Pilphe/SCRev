# SCRev

mitmproxy Python addon I wrote to reverse the order of SoundCloud likes/reposts pages.

If like me you like to discover new music, this addon is very useful for SoundCloud accounts having a lot of likes/reposts, you can listen to what they liked/reposted first.

Accounts having a HUGE amount of likes/reposts aren't handled, see the commented parts (using the id `251087`) of the addon for a workaround, you will need to find the id of the account you want to dig.

It also block comments.
